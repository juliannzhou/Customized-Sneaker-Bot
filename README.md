# Customized-Sneaker-Bot
A basic python script of a bot that allows for automatic signups for customized sneaker on https://www.roommate.studio/ using selenium chromedriver. It is able to simultaneously check for four 
different products through threading and detect updates by refreshing each tab until the image of a product becomes clickable.


Update (03/23): retrieved information after release date on page layout(x-paths) and retrospectively completed the process for auto-signup on all items once after the products become available.


Dependencies: Selenium / Chromedriver
